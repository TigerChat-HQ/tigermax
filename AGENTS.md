# Project rules
- Contact reuses reports through authenticated validation RPCs; report replies and notifications are committed atomically to avoid missing user alerts.
- Public draughts practice uses the shared engine without exposing private multiplayer data; sitemap generation lists only public content routes.
- Draughts legal moves are computed in the shared engine for both human and AI players; flying kings share capture-chain logic so both modes follow identical rules.
- Tiger AI identity context is conversational only and must never be used for account authorization.
- Call media is owned by the global call provider, while the call dialog attaches playback elements; keeping ownership separate prevents navigation from terminating calls.- Tiger AI code changes go through GitHub as draft pull requests for human review; it never merges or publishes on its own, so every code change stays reviewable and reversible.
